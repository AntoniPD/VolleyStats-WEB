# VolleyStats-WEB
The WEB app for volleyball statistics.

# Introduction
This app is for making statistics of a volleyball match. The goal is to achieve higher results in next matches by seeing which elements of the game went wrong in previous matches. 

# How does it work
After you register, you can make team/s and you can add players in that team. When you are done with that you can start a match by chosing a team. During the match you can mark each point, who did it, what was it and etc.

You can see previous completed matches and detailed statistics about them.
